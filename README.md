## What I Do

With 5+ years in digital marketing and a web development background, I build practical AI solutions for startups and medium-sized companies. Currently training as an AI Engineer, I focus on making machine learning work for real business challenges:

- **Content Automation** â€“ Scaling content production without sacrificing quality
- **Predictive Analytics** â€“ Turning data into actionable insights
- **Smart Customer Journeys** â€“ Personalization that actually converts

## My Approach

I don't just adviseâ€”I build. You'll find working code, real implementations, and systems that solve actual problems in my repositories.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in collaborating on projects involving:

- Marketing automation with AI
- Data-driven customer acquisition
- Smart funnel optimization
- ML-powered analytics pipelines
