Hi, I’m Henrik, a marketing technologist with a focus on AI.

With 5+ years in digital marketing and a background in web development, I design and implement systems for start ups and medium sized companies.

Currently training as an AI Engineer, I specialize in applying machine learning to real-world business challenges:
• Content automation
• Predictive analytics
• Smart customer journeys

What makes me different? I don’t just advise, I CREATE. 🔨

Let’s connect if you’re building...
• a smarter funnel
• an automated marketing process
• or just want to get more out of your data
