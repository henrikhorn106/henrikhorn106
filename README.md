# Hi, I'm Henrik 👋

Founder of CREATE AI Automation Agency. I build AI-powered automation that actually works – not theory, but production-ready systems that scale.

My edge? 5+ years in digital marketing before becoming an engineer. I know what businesses need because I've lived on both sides: the growth targets and the technical stack.

## What I Do
• AI content systems that maintain brand voice at scale

• Predictive models that optimize customer journeys in real-time

• n8n/Make workflows connecting CRMs, marketing tools & APIs

• Custom integrations when off-the-shelf won't cut it


## My Approach

I don't just advise—I build. You'll find working code, real implementations, and systems that solve actual problems in my repositories.


## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in collaborating on projects.
