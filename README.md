# Hi, I'm Henrik 👋

I'm a marketing technologist bridging the gap between AI and business impact.

## What I Do

With 5+ years in digital marketing and a web development background, I build practical AI solutions for startups and medium-sized companies. Currently training as an AI Engineer, I focus on making machine learning work for real business challenges:

- **Content Automation** – Scaling content production without sacrificing quality
- **Predictive Analytics** – Turning data into actionable insights
- **Smart Customer Journeys** – Personalization that actually converts

## My Approach

I don't just advise—I build. You'll find working code, real implementations, and systems that solve actual problems in my repositories.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in collaborating on projects involving:

- Marketing automation with AI
- Data-driven customer acquisition
- Smart funnel optimization
- ML-powered analytics pipelines

📫 Feel free to reach out if you're working on something interesting or want to chat about the intersection of marketing and machine learning.
