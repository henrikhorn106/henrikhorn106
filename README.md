Hi, Iâ€™m Henrik, a marketing technologist with a focus on AI.

With 5+ years in digital marketing and a background in web development, I design and implement systems for start ups and medium sized companies.

Currently training as an AI Engineer, I specialize in applying machine learning to real-world business challenges:
- Content automation
- Predictive analytics
- Smart customer journeys

What makes me different? I donâ€™t just advise, I CREATE. ðŸ”¨

Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re building...
- a smarter funnel
- an automated marketing process
- or just want to get more out of your data
